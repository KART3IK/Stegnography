# Steganography Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Steganography Project. Steganography is a technique used to hide sensitive information within seemingly innocuous files, such as images. In this repository, you will find tools and code that enable the encoding and decoding of cypher text in images using both the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method and the hexdump method. Additionally, this project incorporates encryption to enhance the security of hidden data.

Features

LSB Method:-
The project includes an implementation of the LSB steganography technique, allowing you to embed text-based cypher messages into image files. This method is subtle and effective, making it an ideal choice for covert communication.

Hexdump Method:-
In addition to LSB, this project also offers the hexdump steganography method, which encodes text within the hexadecimal representation of image files. Hexdump provides an alternative approach to hiding data and can be useful in scenarios where LSB might not be suitable.
